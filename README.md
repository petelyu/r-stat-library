# R Statistics Library

The R STATISTICS LIBRARY is a collection of useful R code for data management, exploration, statistical estimation and modeling, evaluation, and reporting based on code compiled directly by Peter Lyu (the author), adapted from the author's research and coursework at Harvard University, and shared from colleagues in the Harvard University PhD in Health Policy Program.
