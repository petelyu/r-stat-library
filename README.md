# R Statistics Library

The R STATISTICS LIBRARY is a collection of useful R code for data management, exploration, statistical estimation and modeling, evaluation, and reporting based on code compiled by Peter Lyu (the author), adapted from the author's research and coursework at Harvard University, and shared from colleagues in and around the Harvard University PhD in Health Policy Program. 

The Library is not and does not aim to be an exhaustive summary of the R statistics world. Rather, the Library represents a convenience set of commonly used code that the some may find useful in their research endeavours.

Suggestions for improvements always welcome!

TIP: If viewing the code in R Studio, jump to sections using the menu at the bottom of the source window.
